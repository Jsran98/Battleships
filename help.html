<h1 id="header">How To Play Battleship</h1><br>

<div id="1">
<p>Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of their 
opponent's warships and sink them. You start by clicking play on the main menu which will put you in a lobby. 
Once in a lobby you can rotate your ships to the orientation you want them, and drag and drop them on your left 
grid. Once all your ships are placed you can ready up and you will be matched with another player. 
Whichever player has readied up first will be player one and gets to go first. You use your turn by selecting a 
grid coordinate in the right grid, where you think an enemy ship will be. If you hit an enemy ship it will show 
the square as red, and if you miss it will be blue. Your left grid will also show where your opponent has been 
shooting with the same color scheme. When a player only has two ships left unsunk you will have access to two super
powers. There is the big torpedo super power that hits 5 squares in a + shape, and there is the multishot super power
that allows you to shoot three torpedos in one turn. You may only use one of the super powers once per game, and 
whoever sinks all of their opponents ships first wins.</p>
